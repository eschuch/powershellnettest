# powershellnettest

PowerShell script to test internet delay, transparent proxy, dns redirection, routes problem, MTU and generate CSV file.

To have a reliable test, destination hosts used to generate the test must be far away. As I live in Brazil, USA servers is OK for me.

Make your changes in the script by your self.

The simple bat file call the PS script with some parameters to be more portable. Or run directly the ps1 file.
